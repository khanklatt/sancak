# Project Requirements Document

## Project Objective
[Define the high-level goal this project aims to achieve]

## Requirements (Technical PM Role)

### Functional Requirements
[Use hierarchical numbering: 1, 1.1, 1.1.1, etc.]
[Format: {number}: {STATE}[, {ATTRIBUTES}] - {requirement description}]
[States: DRAFT, APPROVED, IMPLEMENTED, DEPRECATED]
[Attributes: MVP (for breadth-first implementation)]

Example:
- 1.1: APPROVED, MVP - System shall accept user authentication via OAuth2
- 1.2: DRAFT - System shall support multi-factor authentication
- 1.3: DEPRECATED - System shall use custom authentication protocol

### Non-Functional Requirements
[Performance, security, scalability, etc.]

### Architectural Decision Records (Technical PM Role)
[Format: We {shall/must/can} {STRATEGY} given {REASON/CONTEXT}]

CORRECT FORMAT EXAMPLES:
- We must use PostgreSQL for data persistence given ACID compliance requirements
- We shall implement GraphQL for API communication given frontend's need for flexible data fetching
- We can use Redis for session storage given performance and scalability benefits

## Test Specifications (Developer Role)

### Test Cases
[Derived from requirements above - reference requirement numbers]
[Format: Test {number} (Req {requirement_id}): {test description}]

Example:
- Test 1.1.1 (Req 1.1): Given valid OAuth2 credentials, when user attempts login, then authentication succeeds
- Test 1.1.2 (Req 1.1): Given invalid OAuth2 credentials, when user attempts login, then authentication fails with appropriate error

## Tasks (Developer Role)
[Generated task list for APPROVED, MVP requirements]
[Updated as implementation progresses]

- [ ] Task 1: Implement OAuth2 authentication endpoint
- [ ] Task 2: Create user authentication middleware
- [x] Task 3: Setup database schema for user accounts

## Implementation Notes
[Developer insights, blockers, decisions made during coding]

## Test Results
[Track test outcomes for requirements lifecycle management]

## Relevant Files
[Maintained by Developer - list all files created or modified during implementation]
[Format: filepath - brief description of purpose]

Example:
- `src/auth/oauth.py` - OAuth2 authentication implementation
- `tests/test_auth.py` - Authentication test suite
- `config/auth.yaml` - Authentication configuration
